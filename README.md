## Usage

Get into `lua/user/plugins.lua` using neovim and write buffer, the packer will do the rest of it. Easy-peasy!

## LSP

If you want to configure the behavior of your lsp, please see this [manual](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md), or you can type `:h lspconfig-all`.

Take pyright for example, you should find 'pyright' in the [manual](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md), on that pyright section, you find there a repo on first line, click it and it will lead you to the [pyright official repo](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). In that repo, you can find [a manual about how to set pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/settings.md), then you just follow the manual to do you prefer configuration.
