# ðŸ”§ Development Version

Vim/Neovim is famous for its fast-booting and lightweight,  it strictly follows the Unix philosophy, so I don't want extra redundancy in my [main branch](https://github.com/Rogerskelamen/nvim.lua/tree/main). Any plugins or feathures break the rule will appear here.

Although this branch is not the main stream, but I will make sure this branch is also usable.

## What's different?

### [nvim-metals](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals)

Support LSP for [scala lang](https://www.scala-lang.org/).
**You need to install [coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) manually and set java path correctly.**
